                - "AI is a new tool in our toolkit. Like any tool, it needs to be directed."
                - "My role as an architect hasn't changed. I define the vision; the AI is an instrument for implementation."
                - "Today is about learning to manage this tool. Adapting to its quirks and changes is the key skill."

            <h2>The Rapid Pace of AI Development</h2>
            <p>To understand the tools we have today, we need to look at the rapid evolution just this year.</p>
            <p class="story"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never pay for a year-long AI subscription. The field is changing so fast that today's model might be superseded in three months.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>May 2025: A Shift in Access.</strong> DeepSeek releases a model that can be run locally with tools like Ollama, enabling offline experimentation.</li>
                <li><strong>June 2025: Public Previews.</strong> **Gemini 2.5** is released for free, showing significant capabilities but also unpredictable behavior, like getting stuck in loops.</li>
                <li><strong>Late June 2025: New Integrations.</strong> **Claude 3.7** arrives with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing the AI to interact with local files.</li>
                <li><strong>July 2025: The Rise of CLIs.</strong> The **Gemini CLI** is released, moving the AI interface into the developer's native terminal environment.</li>

            <h3>The Transformer & Attention</h3>
            <p>The **Transformer** is the engine of modern AI. The breakthrough that makes it possible is the **Attention Mechanism**.</p>
            <p class="story"><strong>Analogy: The Open-Book Exam.</strong> You don't re-read a whole book for one question. You scan for keywords, "paying attention" to relevant parts. Attention lets the AI weigh the importance of different words, giving it focus.</p>

        <section id="slide-7" class="slide">
            <h3>Creativity & Context</h3>
            <p>An AI's behavior is shaped by two key concepts: **Non-Determinism** (it makes creative, probabilistic guesses) and its **Context Window** (its short-term memory).</p>
            <p class="story"><strong>The Context Window is the model's entire short-term memory.</strong> It's a set number of tokens the model can consider at one time. Information outside this window is forgotten, which is the most common source of errors.</p>

        <section id="slide-7" class="slide">
            <h3>The Unseen Costs of AI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A single AI query can use <strong>10-100x more electricity</strong> than a Google search.</li>
                <li>Training one large model can equal the <strong>lifetime emissions of five cars</strong>.</li>
                <li>In 2022, Google's data centers consumed over <strong>15 billion liters of water</strong> for cooling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="story">This isn't to say AI is bad, but we must be mindful. AI is also a tool being used to design more energy-efficient systems.</p>

        <!-- Slide 9: WSL & Node Setup -->
        <section id="slide-9" class="slide">
            <h3>Setup: The Foundation (WSL & Node)</h3>
            <p>We need a consistent environment. Using the Windows Subsystem for Linux is key.</p>
            <pre><code>
# 1. Install WSL and a specific Ubuntu distribution
wsl --install -d Ubuntu --name Gemini-cli

# 2. Launch our dedicated WSL environment
wsl -d Gemini-cli

# 3. Install NVM (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# 4. Reload shell (exit & relaunch) and install Node.js
nvm install --lts
            </code></pre>

        <!-- Slide 10: Git & Project Setup -->
        <section id="slide-10" class="slide">
            <h3>Setup: The Project (Gemini CLI)</h3>
            <p>Now, let's install the CLI and set our API key.</p>
            <pre><code>
# 1. Install the Gemini CLI globally
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# 2. Set your API Key from Google AI Studio
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

            <p>Now let's install Git and clone the workshop repository.</p>
            <pre><code>
# 1. Install Git in your WSL terminal
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y

# 2. Clone the workshop repository
git clone https://github.com/ross-futuri/gemini-cli-workshop.git

# 3. Navigate into the project directory
cd gemini-cli-workshop

        <!-- Slide 12: The AI Workflow -->
        <section id="slide-12" class="slide">
            <h3>AI Workflows: From Assistant to Agent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Copy/Paste (UI-based):</strong> Basic prompting in a web UI and pasting the code over. Simple and contained.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrated (CLI / MCP):</strong> The AI has access to your file system. More efficient, but requires careful oversight. <strong>(Today's Focus)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Agentic (Unpredictable):</strong> You give the AI a high-level goal and let it run. The results are often not worth the effort.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="story">The most reliable pattern is **Plan, Implement, Review.** We plan the work, the AI implements, and we verify.</p>

            <h3>Pitfalls: Common Failure Modes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context Amnesia:</strong> It's like working with a fast but forgetful coder. It has no long-term memory.</li>

        <!-- Slide 14: Best Practices -->
        <section id="slide-14" class="slide">
            <h3>Best Practices: Your Safety Net</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Version Control Relentlessly.</strong> `git commit` is your only real safety net. The AI *can*, however, be useful for searching git history.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan in Markdown.</strong> An external plan is your source of truth when the AI's context fails.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Your Workspace Clean.</strong> The AI can get confused by old or duplicate files. Use `git status` to track changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Remind It Constantly.</strong> You have to actively manage the AI's focus to keep it from going off-task.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a Consistent Environment.</strong> Run tests in WSL to match the AI's environment and avoid permission issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Slide 15: Advanced Techniques -->
        <section id="slide-15" class="slide">
            <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Code Investigation:</strong> Use the AI to analyze `git log` or `git blame` output to understand code history and intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Static Analysis:</strong> Feed linter or type-checker output to the AI and instruct it to fix the identified issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Task Chaining:</strong> Use a single prompt to orchestrate multi-step tasks, like reading a spec, generating a client, and writing a test.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code Generation:</strong> Ask the AI to create `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files for your application.</li>
            </ul>
