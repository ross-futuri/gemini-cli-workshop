# Project 1: Historical Weather Data Explorer Prompt

Your goal is to create a simple web application using Python and Flask that allows a user to explore the historical weather for **Vancouver, BC, Canada**.
Use the **Open-Meteo Historical Weather API** (`https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive`). The API is free and requires no key.

Ask the user if you need sudo to install anything.
